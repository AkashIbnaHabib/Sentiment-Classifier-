# Sentiment-Classifier-
This Project was built as a part of a course in Coursera "Python Files, Functions and Dictionaries". This project analyses the randomly generated twitter data in a csv file which has text of a tweet , the number retweets of that tweet and the number of replies of that tweet. After analyzing I have generated a csv file which contains he number of retweets number of replies, positive score(number of happy words in a tweet), negative score(number of angry words in a tweet) and the net score for each tweet. Finally I have produced a graph containing net score vs number of retweets.
